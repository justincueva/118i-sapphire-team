# City Problem #6: Emergency Interim Housing (EIH) sites.

# PROMPT: 
    City of San Jose doesnâ€™t have the best understanding of the ideal spots to place Emergency Interim Housing (EIH) sites based on the physical infrastructure around it (ie libraries, hospitals etc) and resident perception

# GOAL: 
    create an application that can help current and potential EIH users access resources and help make their process easier. 

# note: 
i think the translator and the speech bot can be placed in the same page.
it can reduce the excess space and it will look a bit more cohesive. 
it can go under as translator and speech

from the prof
- change reddit to nextdoor
- implement the map ==> connect the data later to make to find the shelters 
- find out what form/ things nextdoor will deem as important for them to know. 
    - gerneate some sample posts abt san jose

- make the 3rd feature (translator) a setting page
    - integrate it into feature 1. 
        - ui change. 
        - make it so that they can change the language of the page. 
    - supporting feature.
